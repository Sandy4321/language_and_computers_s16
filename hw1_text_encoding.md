# Homework 1: Text Encoding

**Due**: February 2, 2016

  
### Problem 1 (20 points)

Do exercise 1 from chapter 1 (Encoding Language) of Dickinson, Brew and 
Meurers' book. However, instead of taking a paragraph from a 
novel, transliterate the following lines from Walt Whitman's poem <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1891/poems/95"><i>A Song of the Rolling Earth</i></a>:

  <p style="margin-left:40px"><i>Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?<br />     those curves, angles, dots?<br />No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the<br />     ground and sea...<br />They are in the air, they are in you. </i><br /></p><p>Make
 sure to state the syllabary you 
chose, and write the transliteration on four lines as in the above 
excerpt. Then provide your answers to (a) and (b), making sure to mark 
them clearly.<br /></p>

### Problem 2 (20 points)
  
Do exercise 2 (parts a, b, c, and d) from chapter 1 (Encoding Language) 
of Dickinson, Brew and Meurers' book. For part (a), give three 
things you would change, and briefly state why. For part (b), name two 
problems. For part (c), give an example of how you would write 
the word “language”. For part (d), you do not need to write down 100 words – just
 say what kinds of words, and give a couple of examples.

### Problem 3 (10 points)

Give the base ten numbers for the following binary numbers.  They are written in standard order, i.e., Big Endian.

<ul><li><div> (a) 10110010</div>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><div> (b) 01101111</div>
</li></ul>


Be sure to show your work.

<i>Tip</i>: there are many, many tutorials for <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary">binary-decimal conversion</a> online that you can use in addition to the course slides.
  

### Problem 4 (10 points)

Write out the word <i><b>Orange</b></i> using <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> code, in both ordinary numbers (decimal) and binary (base 2, in 
standard order). Keep in mind that lowercase and uppercase letters have 
different <acronym title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</acronym> codes!

As an example, here is what this looks like for <b>Austin</b>.

<pre>                      Letter  ASCII number      bit notation<br />                           A               65      01000001<br />                           u              117      01110101<br />                           s              115      01110011<br />                           t              116      01110110<br />                           i              105      01101001<br />                           n              110      01101110<br /></pre>

Be sure to show your work.

### Problem 5 (20 points)

(a) (5 pts) What is the largest base-10 number that can be encoded in 3 bytes using UTF-8?

(b) (15 pts) What is the UTF-8 representation for the Devanagari character ज ("ja")? (Hint: You'll need to look up its decimal value, convert that to binary, and then embed it into the UTF-8 scheme described in the slides.)

Make sure to show your work.

### Problem 6 (20 points)

Do exercise 7 from chapter 1 of the textbook (p. 30). Make 
sure to clearly rank the 10 bigrams you've chosen, such that the bigram 
which you think has the most predictable next word is first. Do this 
before doing part (a). For part (b), compare the results you got from 
others to your first ranking.

As an alternative to asking friends for part (a), you can do a search
for the bigram on a search engine (e.g., by searching for "to the" or
"the United", with the quotes) and then listing the first word that
follows from the snippet given for each search result.
