## Overview Day

- Look at the [L&C course from Spring 2013](http://lnc-s13.utcompling.com) to see what was covered then and grab some of the resources.
- Check out the webpage for [the course on lego robots](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/lego-04/) at Saarland University. See videos of [the lego robot bartender](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/lego-04/page.php?id=barkeeper) we saw in class.
- Create fun (though mostly useless) word clouds with [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/).
